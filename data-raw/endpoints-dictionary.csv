This report provides summary data on the value of receivables owed to the Federal government, the portion of those receivables that are delinquent, and efforts to collect or write off delinquent debt.

Receivables are categorized as being either current or delinquent. Delinquent receivables are also referred to as delinquent debt. Receivables are also categorized by type of receivable: Administrative Receivables, Direct Loans, and Defaulted Guaranteed Loans. Administrative Receivables are non-loan receivables, including fines, payments, and overpayments. Direct Loans and Defaulted Guaranteed Loans are federal loan receivables.

Generally, Federal creditor agencies assess interest on outstanding loan receivables. Federal creditor agencies are also generally required to assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs when receivables become delinquent. The rate of interest is generally governed by 31 U.S.C. Section 3717 and published by the Department of the Treasury.

Collections are not always mutually exclusive.

treasury-report-on-receivables,v2/debt/tror/delinquent_debt,Delinquent Debt,"Delinquent Debt provides delinquent debt amounts owed to the federal government by an individual, organization, or entity other than another federal agency during the reporting period. A non-tax debt is considered delinquent if it has not been paid by the date specified in an agency's initial written demand for payment or applicable agreement. A non-tax debt may become delinquent during the same fiscal year that it was recorded as a receivable or during a subsequent fiscal year.

The total outstanding delinquent debt balance at the end of a fiscal year is the net of debt that remained delinquent from previous fiscal years and debt that became delinquent during that fiscal year, less collections, adjustments, and amounts written off. The calculation of the amount that became delinquent during the fiscal year is based on debt that was between 1 and 365 days delinquent as of September 30 of the Fiscal Year.

treasury-report-on-receivables,v2/debt/tror/collections_delinquent_debt,Collections on Delinquent Debt,"Collections on Delinquent Debt provides amounts of delinquent debt collected during the reporting period. Federal creditor agencies utilize a combination of debt collection tools. Among these collection tools are administrative wage garnishment (AWG), use of private collection agencies (PCAs), offset of Federal and State payments through the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), use of Fiscal Service's Cross-Servicing Program (CS), and litigation. Before using most collection tools, federal creditor agencies must first provide debtors with due process. This includes providing notice and an opportunity to enter into a repayment agreement based on the debtor's financial circumstances, dispute the debt, or object to the intended collection action.

Generally, federal creditor agencies are required to refer delinquent federal non-tax debt to Fiscal Service for collection through its delinquent debt collection programs, known as the Cross-Servicing Program and TOP. Federal creditor agencies generally are required to refer debts at no later than 120 days delinquent to the Cross-Servicing Program and TOP. Before referring a debt to Fiscal Service for collection, federal creditor agencies must provide debtors with notice and an opportunity to enter into a repayment agreement based on the debtor's financial circumstances, dispute the debt, or object to the intended collection action. While federal creditor agencies are responsible for providing this required due process, Fiscal Service also provides debtors with additional opportunities to resolve their debts prior to the initiation of adverse collection action. For example, prior to initiating a collection action, the Cross-Servicing Program sends a demand letter to each debtor, and TOP sends a warning letter to payees before offsetting recurring payments.

Collections are not always mutually exclusive. The amount and count of collections are recorded for each tool or technique that is used to collect funds.",A row displays the amount and/or count of delinquent debt collected for the type of receivable in the reporting quarter.,collections-on-delinquent-debt,record_date,2016-12-31,Quarterly
treasury-report-on-receivables,v2/debt/tror/written_off_delinquent_debt,Written Off Delinquent Debt,"Written Off Delinquent Debt provides amounts of delinquent debt written off during the reporting period. Federal creditor agencies are generally required to write off non-tax debt that is two years delinquent (see Office of Management and Budget Circular A-129). By writing off delinquent federal non-tax debt as uncollectible, federal creditor agencies more accurately reflect the value of their receivables on the books of the United States.

Certain write-offs are categorized as currently not collectible (CNC), which means that collection efforts continue until the agency determines it should terminate those efforts. Currently not collectibles debts are not always mutually exclusive as the amounts and counts are recorded for each tool or technique that is used to collect funds. Other write-offs are categorized as closed out, meaning a federal creditor agency has terminated all debt collection action. Consequently, a federal creditor agency may be required to report such write-offs to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as potential income to the debtor.",A row displays the amount and/or count of delinquent debt written off for the type of receivable in the reporting quarter.,written-off-delinquent-debt,record_date,2016-12-31,Quarterly
