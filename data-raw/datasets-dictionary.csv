Subtotal rows will often be available to access this same information.

Money flowing into the Treasury is known as receipts, and money flowing out is known as outlays. A surplus occurs if the total value of receipts exceeds the value of outlays, and a deficit occurs when the value of outlays exceeds the value of receipts.

The difference between these datasets is equal to the amount of the Federal Financing Bank amount. The MTS only reports interest that has been paid out of the Treasury Account Symbol 20X0550 - Interest on the Public Debt. This does not align with the Total Interest on the Public Debt in the Interest Expense on the Public Debt Outstanding dataset because it does not include the restoration of foregone interest due to the Debt Issuance Suspension Period.

When payments of individual income and Social Security and Medicare taxes are made, the taxpayer makes a single, combined payment and does not report the amounts attributable to each tax. Thus, the MTS reports Social Security and Medicare taxes as estimated amounts and reports individual income taxes as the residual of the combined payments minus the Social Security and Medicare estimated amounts. When the actual amounts of Social Security and Medicare taxes are determined, the MTS reflects the difference between the initial estimates and the actual amounts as an adjustment for prior years' taxes with an offsetting adjustment to individual income taxes. In Fiscal Year 2020, estimates of Social Security and Medicare taxes were made prior to the onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

If current rates deviate from the published rates by 10% or more, Treasury will issue amendments to this quarterly report. An amendment to a currency exchange rate for the quarter will appear on the report as a separate line with a new effective date.  Amendments made at the end of a month can be used for reporting purposes for transactions occurring during the remaining month(s) in the quarter. Example:  A currency amended on April 30th will appear on two lines of the report. One line for the original March 31st published rate and another line for the amended rate effective April 30th which would be valid for reporting purposes for May and June transactions. Amendments will also be issued to reflect the establishment of new foreign currencies. Amendments are included in this dataset beginning March 2021.

Exceptions to using the reporting rates as shown in the report are: collections and refunds to be valued at specified rates set by international agreements, conversions of one foreign currency into another, foreign currencies sold for dollars, and other types of transactions affecting dollar appropriations. See [Volume I Treasury Financial Manual 2-3200](https://tfm.fiscal.treasury.gov/v1/p2/c320.html) for further details.

To ensure all reports are translated at uniform exchange rates, all U.S. government agencies should use these rates, except as noted above, to convert foreign currency balances and reported transactions to U.S. dollar equivalents as of the date of this report and for the ensuing three months.

Each year’s Financial Report also includes restatements of the previous fiscal year’s figures, enabling users to connect prior year ending balances with current year starting balances. The Financial Report is produced by Treasury in coordination with OMB, which is part of the Executive Office of the President. The Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of OMB, and the Comptroller General of the U.S. at the GAO believe that the information discussed in the Financial Report is important to all Americans.",1995-09-30,1995,Annually,"Costs and revenues are presented in the Financial Report on an accrual basis, while the budget presents outlays and receipts, generally on a cash basis. The accrual basis of accounting is an accounting method that reflects expenses (costs) incurred and income (revenue) earned for a period. The cash basis reflects expenses (costs) paid and income (revenue) received for that period.

The consolidated financial statements consist of the accrual-based and sustainability statements. Collectively, the accrual-based financial statements, the sustainability financial statements, and the Notes to the Financial Statements represent basic information that is deemed essential for the consolidated financial statements to be presented in conformity with GAAP.

The accrual-based financial statements are: Statement of Net Cost, Statement of Operations & Changes in Net Position, Balance Sheet, Reconciliation of Net Operating Cost & Budget Deficit, and Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from Budget & Other Activities. They present historical information on what the federal government owns (assets) and owes (liabilities) at the end of the year, what came in (revenues) and what went out (net costs) during the year, and how accrual-based net operating costs of the federal government reconcile to the budget deficit and changes in its cash balance during the year. 

The sustainability financial statements are: Statement of Long-Term Fiscal Projections, Statement of Social Insurance, and Statement of Changes in Social Insurance Amounts. They are designed to illustrate the relationship between projected receipts and expenditures if current policy is continued over a 75 year time horizon and are intended to help citizens understand current policy and the importance and magnitude of policy reforms necessary to make it sustainable. In preparing the sustainability financial statements, management selects assumptions and data that it believes provide a reasonable basis to illustrate whether current policy is sustainable. Current policy is based on current law, but includes several adjustments. Refer to the Notes to the Financial Statements in the published report for adjustment details. As the assumptions underlying these statements do not consider changes in policy or all potential future events that could affect future income, future expenditures, and, hence, sustainability, the projections do not reflect any adverse economic consequences resulting from continuously rising debt levels. A large number of factors affect the sustainability financial statements, and future events and circumstances cannot be estimated with certainty. Therefore, even if current policy is continued, there will be differences between the estimates in the sustainability financial statements and actual results, and those differences may be material."

slgs-daily-rate-table,State and Local Government Series (SLGS) Daily Rate Table,The State and Local Government Series (SLGS) Daily Rate Table dataset provides interest rates for time deposit securities with a maturity of one month up to 40 years and a daily rate for Demand Deposit securities.,1992-06-15,1992,Daily,"SLGS securities are offered for sale to issuers of state and local government tax-exempt debt to assist with compliance of yield restriction or arbitrage rebate provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.

Subscribers may invest in time deposit or demand deposit types of securities.

All SLGS securities are issued in book-entry form and are non-marketable.

Demand Deposit Rates:
For Demand Deposit securities, the interest rate is based on an adjustment of the average yield in the most recent auction of 13-week Treasury bills. The demand rate is a daily rate and is reset each day for outstanding Demand Deposit securities. As you can see, the Demand Deposit rate covers all Demand Deposit securities issued, regardless of the redemption date.

Time Deposit Rates:
For Time Deposit securities, the interest rate earned is one basis point below the current Treasury borrowing rate for a security of comparable maturity. For Time Deposit securities, you must know the security life (i.e., term) to find your maximum allowable rate.

The column headings From and Through refer to the security life. If the security life is more than one time increment, but not quite the next increment, use the shorter term. For example, if the security will be held for 65 days, you would use the 00-02 (two month) rate, not the 00-03 (three month) rate. For instance, if you have a security that is issued September 30, 2013, and matures September 30, 2014, then the security life is exactly 1 year.

If the security term is 01-00 (meaning one year, zero months) and the rate listed is 0.11% the maximum interest rate available is 0.11%. You may also choose any interest rate from 0% to 0.11% for your security. You are not required to accept the maximum allowable rate, but you cannot choose an interest rate higher than the maximum allowable rate. See a more [detailed interpretation of the SLGS Daily Rate Table From and Through columns](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/static-data/published-reports/slgs-daily-rate/SLGSRateTableHelp.pdf)."
fed-credit-similar-maturity-rates,Federal Credit Similar Maturity Rates,"The Federal Credit Similar Maturity Rates dataset provides the annual rates for outstanding fixed-rate Treasury securities, categorized on the basis of their remaining maturity.",1992-09-30,1992,Annually,"All rates are stated as simple annual rates, which differ from bond equivalent rates and bank discount rates. The 10-20 year and the 20+ year intervals were a single interval in the 1992-1994 Budgets. The separate intervals were effective with the 1995 Budget.

The rates for 1992-2001 are actual fiscal year averages derived from the prevailing market yields during the fiscal year, excluding the last five business days, on outstanding fixed-rate Treasury securities, categorized on the basis of their remaining maturity. The rates for 2002 and beyond are actual fiscal year averages derived from the prevailing market yields during the fiscal year, excluding the last ten business days, on outstanding fixed-rate Treasury securities, categorized on the basis of their remaining maturity.

The rates above are used, for the FY 1992 through FY 2000 cohorts only, to calculate credit subsidy cost, to re-estimate credit subsidy cost, and to calculate the interest income and expense of the financing accounts. They can be used in the Office of Management and Budget credit subsidy calculator without modification."
